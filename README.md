Child migration or "children in migration or mobility" (sometimes more generally "children on the move") is the movement of people ages 0â€“17 within or across political borders, with or without their parents or a legal guardian, to another country or region. How fast are these numbers growing?

In 2020, there were an estimated 35.5 million international migrant children globally, the largest number ever recorded. This corresponds to around 1 in 66 children worldwide living outside their country of birth, whatever their reason for having crossed borders.
